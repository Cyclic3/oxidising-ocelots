          <p><h3>Why?</h3></p>
          Our school banned playing card games in school. We looked at a range of solutions:
          <ul>
          <li>Remote controlled robots with cameras, so we weren't technically playing in</li>
          <li>Other games which could be reduced to cards through a polynomial-time reduction</li>
          <li>A military coo</li>
          <li><s>Actually do some work</s></li>
          </ul>
          We eventually settled on writing our own.

          This was initially supposed to be a significantly less good version of exploding kittens,
          our favourite card game, but we realised it would be too hard.

          Instead, we have ripped out all of the fun strategy for a Turing-complete flow control.

          And I mean turing-complete. When a player leaves, we have to reset flow,
          or else we have to solve the halting problem.

          <br><br>
          <p><h3>How?</h3></p>
          This was carefully crafted in a beautiful flow of Rust, Go and Javascript,
          for safety, high speeds and code clarity.

          The code interfaces using high performance asynchronous socket io.
          <br><br>

          Lol jk, we hacked it together in C++ and Python, and data is passed as json over stdio
          because sockets are hard.

          <br><br>

          If you actually want to help, or just want to laugh at awfully indented code with more whitespace
          than text (Lukshan), or a C++ backend that cannot be truely understood by any sane mortal,
          and may actually be cursed by Satan himself (Cyclic3),
          visit our <a href="https://github.com/Cyclic3/oxidising-ocelots">github</a>.

          <br><br>

          The develop and master branches are autobuilt on push,
          and are pushed to the <a href="https://beta.oxidisingocelots.co.uk/">beta</a> and
          <a href="https://www.oxidisingocelots.co.uk/">production</a> domains.

          <br>

          Everything is hosted on a hacked together kuberentes cluster,
          which is built from laptops and cobbled together bits of old computer.
